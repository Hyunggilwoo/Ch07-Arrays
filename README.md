# Chapter 07: Arrays

Please complete the following programming exercises from the textbook. You may assist your fellow students but do **NOT** share answers/code.

- 7.5 mode
- 7.8 median
- 7.16 append
- 7.20 matrixAdd

Extra-credit: Project 7.1 integerAdd
For the 7.5 problem, 
Here was my brainstormin:

// To find the mode of an array, I need to assess the arrays and find the most frequently mentioned integer.
	// I care about how many times was the integer mentioned, which is mode.
	// Initialize a counter for the number of times the integer was mentioned. 
	// Initialize a int temp to store the integer that is sorted.
	//so scan through the array with a for loop
	
  I finally referred to finding the mode in this tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKR3uA-Ytno
For the 7.8 problem, I referred to the sorting method. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CJq3XV2PBU&t=36s
I began using the Array.getInt method from Array.
